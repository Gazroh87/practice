    <!-- divs and spans -->
    <div>
      (This is a div. A div is a block, meaning it has a line break before it
      and after it.)
    </div>
    <div>
      (This is another div. It can be used to group any number of elements, so
      you can insert a headline, a bunch of paragraphs, and a bulleted list
      inside a single div block. The div tag is a great way to subdivide a page
      into logical areas, like a banner, footer, sidebar and so on.)
    </div>
    <span>(This is a span.)</span>
    <span
      >(This is another span. Spans are inline like paragraphs. The span tag is
      used for inline elements: words or phrases that appear inside a larger
      paragraph or heading.)</span

    <p>Some words of wisdom from "A Tale of Two Cities":</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
        wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it
        was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the
        season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of
        despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were
        all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-in
        short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its
        noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
        evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It's amazing what you can fit into one sentence.</p>

    <!-- Box Model -->
    <p class="BoxModel">
      When determining the space used by an element, remember to include the
      border width. For example of the padding is set to 10px, the margin set to
      5px, and the border-width set to 3px, the space used (in addition to the
      actual element content) will be (2 * 10)+(2 * 5)+(2 * 3)=36px.
